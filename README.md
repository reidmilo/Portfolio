# About Me

Greetings, I am Oliver Reidmiller, a third-year senior at Dickinson College in Carlisle, PA. Currently pursuing a degree in Data Analytics with minors in Economics and Music, I hail from New Jersey. My academic journey has been enriched by a diverse range of interests, with ongoing projects exploring the intersection of music, gender and sexuality studies, kinesiology, and economics.

## Academic Pursuits

As a dedicated student, I have delved into various data projects that align with my passions. These projects reflect my commitment to applying data analytics across interdisciplinary domains, demonstrating my enthusiasm for leveraging data to gain valuable insights.

## Professional Experience

Since March 2023, I have been serving as a Data Analytics Fellow with the Dickinson College Athletics Department. In this role, I have collaborated with the football, men's lacrosse, and women's lacrosse teams, pioneering the integration of analytics into their strategies for both games and training sessions. I take pride in being the inaugural Data Analytics Fellow to leverage data science and statistics to support our coaching staff.

This semester, I am actively engaged in assisting the women's lacrosse team by crafting data visualizations and implementing data-driven gameplay strategies. Concurrently, I mentor and supervise men's lacrosse players keen on expanding their understanding of data science and sports analytics.

## Future Aspirations

With my anticipated graduation from Dickinson College in June, I am poised to transition into the professional arena. My goal is to secure a position that allows me to continue harnessing my analytical skills within a professional sports team environment. I am eager to further develop my expertise and contribute to the dynamic field of sports analytics.

I invite you to explore my professional journey and connect with me as I embark on this exciting next chapter after graduation.
