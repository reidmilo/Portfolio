# About Me

Hello, I'm Oliver Reidmiller, a third-year senior at Dickinson College in Carlisle, PA. Originally from New Jersey, I am currently studying Data Analytics with minors in Economics and Music. My academic journey has been shaped by a diverse set of interests, and I'm actively engaged in various data analytics projects focused on the intersection of music, gender and sexuality studies, kinesiology, and economics.

## Academic Pursuits

As a liberal arts student, I engage in data analytics projects to explore and deepen my understanding of various academic passions. These projects not only showcase my commitment to these interdisciplinary areas but also highlight my enthusiasm for leveraging data to derive meaningful insights.

Moreover, my academic journey extends beyond data analytics, encompassing coursework in finance and Spanish. I've pursued these subjects from being interested in gaining knowledge in a variety of fields. Alongside my analytical pursuits, I contribute to the school's music community as a French horn player. Currently, I am preparing C. Saint Saëns: Morceau de Concert for my senior concerto.

## Professional Experience

Since March 2023, I've been serving as a Data Analytics Fellow with the Dickinson College Athletics Department. Collaborating with the football, men's lacrosse, and women's lacrosse teams as the founding Data Analytics Fellow, I've been instrumental in integrating analytics into their strategies for both games and training sessions, making data science and statistics valuable tools for our coaching staff.

This semester, my focus is on assisting the women's lacrosse team by creating data visualizations and implementing data-driven gameplay strategies. Simultaneously, I mentor and supervise men's lacrosse players eager to explore the intersections of data science and sports analytics.

## Future Aspirations

As I near graduation from Dickinson College in June, I look forward to entering the professional arena. My goal is to secure a position where I can continue to apply my analytical skills. Exploring various industries, I am open to joining any data team that aligns with my skills and interests. The dynamic field of data analytics presents an exciting opportunity to further develop my expertise and contribute significantly.
