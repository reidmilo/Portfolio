https://github.com/reidmilo/Examining-the-Correlation-Between-Church-Density-and-Anti-LGBT-Legislation/tree/main) This project delves into sociopolitical influences by exploring the correlation between church density and anti-LGBT legislation. Through data analysis, I aim to understand voting patterns and the broader sociopolitical landscape in the United States.

2. [Predictive Modeling of Speed Dating Matches using Machine Learning:](https://github.com/reidmilo/Dynamics-of-Speed-Dating-Matches-using-Machine-Learning/tree/main) This study utilizes the Speed Dating dataset, curated by Sheena S. Iyengar and collected during experiments conducted by Columbia, Harvard, and Stanford University professors. Focused on understanding decision-making in dating, the project builds classification models to predict matches based on individual characteristics. The binary response variable, 'match,' serves as a key metric, offering potential applications in enhancing online dating recommendations for increased compatibility.

3. **Machine Learning on Lacrosse Team GPS Training Data:** Utilizing machine learning techniques, I am analyzing GPS training data for the lacrosse team. The objective is to identify performance correlations between different measures, providing valuable insights for optimizing training strategies.
